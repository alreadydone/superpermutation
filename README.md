# Superpermutation

In combinatorial mathematics, a superpermutation on n symbols is a string that contains each permutation of n symbols as a substring.

It has been shown that for 1 ≤ n ≤ 5, the smallest superpermutation on n symbols has length 1! + 2! + … + n! (sequence [A180632](https://oeis.org/A180632) in the OEIS). The first five superpermutations have respective lengths 1, 3, 9, 33, and 153, forming the strings 1, 121, 123121321, 123412314231243121342132413214321, and the string:
